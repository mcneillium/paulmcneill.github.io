                    My technical journey began with mastering a broad spectrum of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. During my career and within my time as Creative Director at Paramount Perceptions, I led projects that pushed the boundaries of both design and functionality. These experiences honed my ability to manage teams, oversee complex projects, and align technical deliverables with strategic objectives, consistently delivering solutions that resonate with users and clients alike.
